1, Upgrade from 0.13 to 0.14.1
     aï¼Œleverage the request-termination plugin for stop the traffics.
     b, Provision a 0.14 node and configure it as you wish (environment variables/ configuration file).
        Make sure to point this new 0.14 node to your current datastore.
     c, Without starting the 0.14 node, run the 0.14 migrations against your current datastore:
        kong migrations up [-c kong.conf]
     d, You can now provision a fresh 0.14 cluster pointing to your migrated datastore and start your 0.14 nodes.
     e, Gradually switch your traffic from the 0.13 cluster to the new 0.14 cluster. Remember, once your database is
     migrated, your 0.13 nodes will rely on their cache and not on the underlying database.
     Your traffic should switch to the new cluster as quickly as possible.
     f, Once your traffic is fully migrated to the 0.14 cluster, decommission your 0.13 cluster.

2, Upgrade from 0.14.1 to 1.0.3

   Preliminary Checks
     a, You need to upgrade to 0.14.1 first
     b, Kong 1.0 will refuse to run migrations if you have any entity configured using /apis in your datastore.
        Create equivalent Routes and Services and delete your APIs.(Note that Kong does not do this automatically)
     c, If you use additional plugins other than the ones bundled with Kong, make sure they are compatible with Kong 1.0 prior to upgrading.
        See the section above on Plugins for information on plugin compatibility.

   Step:
     The full migration is now split into two steps, which are performed via commands
        kong migrations up
        kong migrations finish.

     a, Download 1.0, and configure it to point to the same datastore as your 0.14 cluster. Run kong migrations up.
     b, Both 0.14 and 1.0 nodes can now run simultaneously on the same datastore.
        Start provisioning 1.0 nodes, but do not use their Admin API yet.
        Prefer making Admin API requests to your 0.14 nodes instead.
     c, Gradually divert traffic away from your 0.14 nodes, and into your 1.0 cluster.
        Monitor your traffic to make sure everything is going smoothly.
     d, When your traffic is fully migrated to the 1.0 cluster, decommission your 0.14 nodes
     e, From your 1.0 cluster, run: kong migrations finish.
        From this point on, it will not be possible to start 0.14 nodes pointing to the same datastore anymore.
        Only run this command when you are confident that your migration was successful.
        From now on, you can safely make Admin API requests to your 1.0 nodes.

3, Demo path:
1, Set up a 0.13 kong Cluster and
   Add a Api for Test ,enable okta-auth plugin.
   Make sure it works.

2, upgrade from 0.13 to 0.14.1
2, upgrade from 0.0.14.1 to 1.0.3
